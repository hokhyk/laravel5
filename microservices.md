Seperation of requirements as services:
1. Nouns: usually models  
2. Verbs: Each of these verbs can be thought of as an action, or a relationship, between one or two entities.    
Typically you will want to have a separate service for each noun. 
Depending on the complexity of the verb, it may or may not warrant its own service.
3. Another common concern for separating data is how to retrieve user data versus how to authenticate a user.

# As a rule of thumb, you should be able to describe what a service does using a single sentence, and that sentence shouldn’t contain the word and. 

## Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.  —Melvin Conway
